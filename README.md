# README
What did I do?
First of all, I reread the PowerPoints from class. Then, I started working on the search bar for each
of my controllers. After I completed the search bars, I was determined to get autocomplete working for
them as well, which I was successful in, but I only got the autocomplete to work for one column
in each of my controllers. After I completed the search bars and autocompletions, I started working on
validations. This was where I did some more research on Regex and even played a few of the games from
regexcrossword.com. Lastly, I created tests following the Testing PowerPoint. Creating the tests was where
I spent the most time for this project, and I still hope to get better at creating these tests in the future.
I also created a seed file following the instructions on rroblak's seed_dump gem on GitHub.

What commands did I issue? 
* rails test
* rails test:system
* rake db:seed:dump

What did you learn?
I learned how to seed a database using the seed_dump gem. I learned how general expressions make more
specific and concise ways of making validations in Rails. I learned how Rails creates paths using
the autocomplete_rails gem. 
For next time, I hope to understand how to create better, more accurate tests even though I got 100% code 
coverage through the "rails test" command for my application. 

Tests
* 100% codecov
* My code coverage and simplecov analysis are found in the coverage folder. (index.html)
